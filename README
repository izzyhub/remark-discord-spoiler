A remark plugin that turns discord style spoilers into `<details>` `<summary>` tags.

e.g. 

```markdown
  This isn't a spoiler. ||This is a spoiler||
```

becomes 

```html
This isn't a spoiler. 
<details class="spoiler">
  <summary class="spoilerTitle">
    spoiler
  </summary>
  This is a spoiler
</details>
```

You can also customize the summary part by adding parenthesis immediately after the first `||`

e.g.

```markdown
  This isn't a spoiler. ||(Game of Thrones spoiler) The real game was the friends we made along the way.||
```

becomes

```html
This isn't a spoiler.
<details class="spoiler">
  <summary class="spoilerTitle">
    Game of Thrones spoiler
  </summary>
  The real game was the friends we made along the way.
</details>
```

# Random Thoughts after Watching Yellowjackets season 3 episode 8

This is just like a normal sentence. Young Shauna is so ||evil|| in Yellowjackets I don't get how it connects to older Shauna. Like they've made nods to her being darker but idk. ||I think she
had to have murdered Lottie for it to fit currently||. But maybe they'll show a softening
when she has to return to society?

||(speculation/want) I really want Melissa to be the Hillary Swank character and for her to be the one sorta messing with Shauna||
